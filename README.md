# Ticketmasterclone
The "Ticket Master" smart contract is an Ethereum-based ERC-721 token contract that enables the creation, listing, and sale of event tickets on the blockchain. It provides ownership control to the contract creator, allowing them to list event occasions with details like name, cost, date, time, and location. Users can purchase tickets for specific occasions, subject to availability and payment verification. The contract tracks ticket ownership and seat status, and users can retrieve event information and see which seats are already taken. Additionally, the contract allows the owner to withdraw the contract's Ether balance from ticket sales. This contract forms the basis for a decentralized ticketing system, enhancing transparency and security in the ticketing industry.
